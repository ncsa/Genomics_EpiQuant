# Current Status

## SPAEML

* SPAEML works given input formatted in a clean table structure where rows are sample names and columns are genotypes/phenotypes and sample names are identical between the two input files.
* The ANOVA table in the output is a Standard ANOVA table, and does not yet have AIC, BIC, mBIC yet included.
* Benchmarking had been done on iForge (using Spark Standalone), but since this benchmarking a major optimization was introduced to the code (ISSUE #6) and tests need to be redone.
* Before computing anything, the program first checks to see whether the directory that will hold the output already exists. If it does, the program exits. We do not want users to erase output files that took a lot of work to generate because they forgot to rename the output directory flag.
